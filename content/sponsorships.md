## Business Sponsorship

**Platinum Sponsorship: $999/month via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/nunomaduro)**

If your company relies on my open source tools, becoming a sponsor places your logo on my content and helps sustain these projects.

I currently share content with a community of **59k followers** on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/enunomaduro), **15k subscribers** on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/nunomaduro), and **2k followers** on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/enunomaduro), with regular videos and live coding sessions throughout the week.

### What's Included
- Your link in all YouTube video descriptions
- Your logo featured during livestreams and videos
- Optional logo placement on [pestphp.com](https://pestphp.com)
- The knowledge that you're supporting tools used by thousands of developers

### Terms
- No refunds for previous months of sponsorship
- Either party can cancel at any time with no further obligation
- Please email me at [enunomaduro@gmail.com](mailto:enunomaduro@gmail.com) before sponsoring to confirm availability

**One-time fee: $10,000 via wire transfer**

For companies interested in dedicated content about their products, I offer a package that includes:
- 2-hour livestream featuring your product
- Dedicated video on my YouTube channel
