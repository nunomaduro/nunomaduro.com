Hello! I'm Nuno.

I spend my days crafting tools that make developers' lives a bit easier. As a member of the [Laravel](https://laravel.com) core team, I have the privilege of contributing to a framework that powers websites for companies like OpenAI, Apple, Marvel, and many more around the world.

My journey in open source has led me to create projects like [PEST](https://pestphp.com), [Larastan](https://github.com/larastan/larastan), and [Pint](https://github.com/laravel/pint), along with [many others](https://github.com/nunomaduro) I maintain. These tools have become industry standards in modern PHP development. Collectively, they've been downloaded more than 500,000,000 times.

When I'm not writing code, you might find me:
- Sharing ideas at [conferences](/talks) around the globe
- Creating content on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/nunomaduro) with new videos every weekday
- Live coding on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/nunomaduro) on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
- Organizing community events like [PHP Portugal](https://php-portugal.com)
